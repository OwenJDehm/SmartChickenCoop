# SmartChickenCoop

A smart IoT bird hatchery and coop, powered by a Particle Photon for my EE1301 class' Final Project

The Coop can control incubation of eggs with a heat lamp that can be turned on and off remotely, or triggered by the absence of motion with a PIR (motion) Sensor. The Coop's temperature can be monitored by the user remotely, with a built in AC system to cool the coop if it exceeding 25 degrees celsius. The AC system can be remotely turned on or off by the user as well. As a security measure to protect the Coop and its precious contents, the Coop has a motion sensor on the outside by the door that can monitors how many threats walk past in the night (the higher count, the more likely there is a predator checking out the Coop!) this counter can be viewed in the control panel (HTML file) that controls the other components of the Coop. The door of the Coop can also be remotely opened and closed by the owner/user.
