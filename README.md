# SmartChickenCoop

A smart IoT bird hatchery and coop, powered by a Particle Photon for my EE1301 class' Final Project

The Coop can control incubation of eggs with a heat lamp that can be turned on and off remotely, or triggered by the absence of motion with a PIR (motion) Sensor. The Coop's temperature can be monitored by the user remotely, with a built in AC system to cool the coop if it exceeding 25 degrees celsius. The AC system can be remotely turned on or off by the user as well. Food can be dispensed remotely from a dropper system by the user with the push of a button on their phone, the food dispenser also dispenses food twice a day. As a security measure to protect the Coop and its precious contents, the Coop also has a built in security system, that outputs sound and text messages as alarms. Things that can trigger the security system: Temperature exceeds 40 degreees celsius A motion sensor by the doors is triggered when the Coop's doors are closed - will have a burst of sound to deter any potential predators Any system malfunctions
